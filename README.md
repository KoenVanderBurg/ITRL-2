Assignment 2, Introduction to Reinforcement Learning

This repository was originally created for the second assignment in the Introduction to Reinforcement Logic course. The code presents three different model-free reinforcement learning algorithms; Q- Learning, SARSA and Expected-SARSA. These algorithms are designed for learning problems such as the Cliff Walking problem, which is the current problem it was designed for.

In the Cliff Walking environment there is a reinforcement learning agent which has two different starting points (x,y) and is tasked with finding the goal using the fastest possible route. The environment of the agent contains cliffs in which the agent can fall, on which the agent is returned to its starting position.

The output of the program are learning curves indicating the performance of each reinforcement learning algorithm. The learning curves are based on different learning speeds, and averaged over multiple repitions.
